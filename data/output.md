# Half Year Review

The word ‘commitment’ has long held significant meaning for us. One of our five company values, it has resonated strongly in recent months as we reflect on the efforts required through the pandemic period. It resonates further still as we move forward, describing the focus on our long-term aims and the discipline required to achieve them.

Getting our life-preserving product out to patients was paramount during the peak of the pandemic – this came first, and everything else flowed from that. As we said back in May at our full-year result, we did not let these events divert us from our long-term course, and that is worth repeating now. We remain committed to sustainable, profitable growth, and our confidence in the future is unchanged. We are investing significantly in that future and, as we do so, our people are focused on identifying the right near-term actions that strengthen us for the long term.

# Financial Results

As we said in our trading update in August, revenue was down on the prior period but elevated compared with pre-pandemic levels. For the six months ended 30 September 2022, total operating revenue was $690.6 million, 23 per cent below the same period last year, or 27 per cent in constant currency. This represents a 21 per cent increase on the first half of the 2020 financial year ($570.9 million). Net profit after tax was $95.9 million, 57 per cent below the same period last year, or 65 per cent in constant currency.

# Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Interim Report 2023

Our Hospital product group comprised 64 per cent of revenue at $438.7 million, representing a 35 per cent decline on the prior year, or 37 per cent in constant currency. This marks a 24 per cent increase compared to the comparable pre-pandemic period, being the first half of the 2020 year ($353.6 million). Hospital consumables sales in constant currency were down 19 per cent on the prior year, but up 25 per cent on the first half of 2020. We believe customer stock levels have been elevated during the first half, reflecting hospital purchases of considerable amounts of product in preparation for an Omicron wave which, for the most part, proved less severe than originally anticipated. Ultimately, we see these stocking dynamics as short-term, and the fundamentals of our sales strategy remain the same. Our teams are committed to helping improve clinical practice and ensuring the hardware our customers have purchased is used to benefit a broader range of patients requiring respiratory support.

Our Homecare product group delivered revenue of $249.9 million, representing growth of 10 per cent on the first half last year or 4 per cent in constant currency. Pleasingly, our OSA masks and accessories revenue increased 10 per cent in constant currency. The early reception to our new Evora™ Full mask has been very favourable. We received 510(k) approval in the United States in April and have since seen strong sales volumes and positive user feedback. This adds to the momentum for our OSA team who are working hard on a robust product pipeline.

# Unlocking Future Growth: Proposed Karaka Campus

We have repeatedly signalled the importance of long-term infrastructure planning to help us deliver on our sustainable, profitable growth strategy and our aspirations of doubling constant currency revenue every five to six years. To take advantage of the opportunities ahead of us, we need more space, and we took an important step in securing this during the first half. In September, we entered into a conditional agreement, subject to approval by the Overseas Investment Office, to purchase a 105-hectare site for an additional New Zealand campus in Karaka, Auckland.
# FRW Healthcare Inc. Interim Report 2023


Gross margin for the half was 59.8 per cent, down from 63.1 per cent in the prior period and below our long-term target of 65 per cent. Elevated freight rates remain a factor – major global routes are seeing prices soften, though legs in and out of New Zealand remain behind this curve, with prices taking longer to normalise. The half has also seen us manage through manufacturing inefficiencies, as we have been carefully balancing demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput and higher rates of absenteeism in our manufacturing workforce due to sickness.

# Strategic Progress

In May, we introduced our latest anesthesia products – Optiflow Switch™ and Optiflow Trace™ – which provide even more compelling reasons to use F&P’s Optiflow technology during general anesthesia and procedural sedation. Adding to our anesthesia salesforce has been a clear priority in the months since and will remain so going forward. Feedback from anesthesiologists continues to be positive and gives us confidence in both the benefit to patients and the size of the market opportunity.

We are continuing with a controlled market release of our new Airvo™ 3 nasal high flow device in Australasia while seeking regulatory clearances further afield. We believe the new device is an attractive proposition, with a closed loop system for targeted oxygen delivery and an integrated battery to allow for more portability through the hospital.

# Environmental and Social Responsibility

Earlier this year, FRW Healthcare Inc. articulated its intentions in the form of a new Environmental and Social Responsibility policy, aiming to have a lasting positive impact on society and the environment. This statement of intent guides the newly formed governance group, comprised of subject matter experts from around the business working together to identify improvements and step-changes globally.

# Board Update

FRW Healthcare Inc. welcomed Cather Simpson, PhD, as a non-executive director in June, bringing the board up to full strength. The Board of Directors has approved an interim dividend of 17.5 cents per share for the six months to 30 September 2022, marking a 3% increase from the prior financial year.

# Profit Share

To recognize the efforts of its employees, the Board has approved a discretionary profit-sharing payment of $4 million for qualifying employees.

|Profit after tax|221.8 NZ$M|95.9 NZ$M|-57%|-65%|

Constant currency (CC) removes the impact of exchange rate movements. This approach is used to assess the Group’s underlying comparative financial performance without any impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Total profit after tax for the period was $95.9 million, a 57% decline from the same period last year, or 65% in constant currency.

# Gross Margin

Gross margin at 59.8% decreased by 533 basis points in constant currency from the same period last year. Continued elevated freight costs and air freight utilization this period impacted constant currency gross margin by approximately 290 basis points compared to pre-COVID-19 rates. Manufacturing inefficiencies were also experienced this year as we balance demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput.

# Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased 8% (3% in constant currency) to $286.5 million, reflecting ongoing expenditure to support global sales growth and development of our product pipeline. R&D spend of $84.2 million grew 11% reflecting underlying growth and the timing of R&D and clinical projects. Over the long term we plan for R&D spend to grow in line with constant currency revenue growth.

# Financing Expenses

The net financing expense increase reflects the exchange losses on the revaluation of foreign currency interest-bearing liabilities. Excluding the impact of foreign currency revaluations, net financing expense was in line with the prior period.

# Tax

Our effective tax rate for the period was 16.1%, down from 26.3% in the prior period reflecting foreign currency translation gains that are non-taxable. The R&D tax credit this period of $7.6 million (Sep 2021: $7.4 million) represents the estimated eligible R&D expenditure incurred during the period. Excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit, the effective tax rate was 22.7% (Sep 2021: 28.8%).

# Revenue

Operating revenue was $690.6 million, a 23% decline from the prior comparable period (PCP) or 27% in constant currency. Hospital revenue decreased 37% in constant currency as we lapped significant COVID-19 driven demand last year and apparent elevated customer inventory levels during this period. Homecare revenue grew 4% in constant currency.
# FRW Healthcare, Inc. Interim Report 2023

# Fisher & Paykel Healthcare - INTERIM REPORT 2023

# FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS

The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates, with approximately 99% of operating revenue generated in currencies other than NZD as shown below:

|Currency|Percentage|Currency Code|Average Daily Spot Rate 2021|Average Daily Spot Rate 2022|Average Conversion Exchange Rate 2021|Average Conversion Exchange Rate 2022|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|US dollars|45%|USD|0.7077|0.6312|0.6769|0.6700|
|Euros|20%|EUR|0.5938|0.6095|0.5594|0.5445|
|Australian dollars|6%| | | | | |
|Japanese yen|6%| | | | | |
|Chinese yuan|4%| | | | | |
|British pounds|3%| | | | | |
|Canadian dollars|3%| | | | | |
|Korean won|3%| | | | | |
|New Zealand dollars|1%| | | | | |
|Other currencies|9%| | | | | |

Approximately 60% of COGS and over 50% of operating expenses are in currencies other than NZD.

Net profit after tax was increased by $6.1 million compared to the prior period due to the impact of foreign currency.

The effect of balance sheet translations for the period resulted in an increase in operating revenue of $18.6 million (Sep 2021: $2.5 million increase) and an increase in profit after tax of $0.8 million (Sep 2021: $2.4 million increase).

The hedging programme contributed a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million (Sep 2021: $21.1 million gain).

The average daily spot rate and the average conversion exchange rate of the main foreign currency exposures for the reported periods are set out in the table above.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

To the shareholders of Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited

# REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR CONCLUSION

We have reviewed the consolidated financial statements of Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group),
which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2022, and the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months period
ended on that date, and other explanatory information.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group do
not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2022, and its financial performance and cash flows for the
six months period then ended on that date, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) and New Zealand
Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (NZ IAS 34).

BASIS FOR CONCLUSION

We conducted our review in accordance with the New Zealand Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements Performed
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of
the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual financial
statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these ethical requirements. In addition to our role as auditor,
our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of executive remuneration benchmarking and providing market survey data, regulatory
tax compliance procedures in Mexico, and other assurance services in relation to constant currency disclosures. The provision of these other services
has not impaired our independence.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS’ FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Directors of the Company are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IAS 34 and NZ IAS 34 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated financial statements based on our review. NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 and NZ IAS 34.

A review of consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we might identify in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these consolidated financial statements.

WHO WE REPORT TO

This report is made solely to the Company’s Shareholders, as a body. Our review work has been undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in our review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Shareholders, as a body, for our review procedures, for this report, or for the conclusion we have formed.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Keren Blakey.

# Half Year Review

The word ‘commitment’ has long held significant meaning for us. One of our five company values, it has resonated strongly in recent months as we reflect on the efforts required through the pandemic period. It resonates further still as we move forward, describing the focus on our long-term aims and the discipline required to achieve them.

Getting our life-preserving product out to patients was paramount during the peak of the pandemic – this came first, and everything else flowed from that. As we said back in May at our full-year result, we did not let these events divert us from our long-term course, and that is worth repeating now. We remain committed to sustainable, profitable growth, and our confidence in the future is unchanged. We are investing significantly in that future and, as we do so, our people are focused on identifying the right near-term actions that strengthen us for the long term.

# Financial Results

As we said in our trading update in August, revenue was down on the prior period but elevated compared with pre-pandemic levels. For the six months ended 30 September 2022, total operating revenue was $690.6 million, 23 per cent below the same period last year, or 27 per cent in constant currency. This represents a 21 per cent increase on the first half of the 2020 financial year ($570.9 million). Net profit after tax was $95.9 million, 57 per cent below the same period last year, or 65 per cent in constant currency.

# FRW Healthcare, Inc. Interim Report 2023

# Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Interim Report 2023

Our Hospital product group comprised 64 per cent of revenue at $438.7 million, representing a 35 per cent decline on the prior year, or 37 per cent in constant currency. This marks a 24 per cent increase compared to the comparable pre-pandemic period, being the first half of the 2020 year ($353.6 million). Hospital consumables sales in constant currency were down 19 per cent on the prior year, but up 25 per cent on the first half of 2020. We believe customer stock levels have been elevated during the first half, reflecting hospital purchases of considerable amounts of product in preparation for an Omicron wave which, for the most part, proved less severe than originally anticipated. Ultimately, we see these stocking dynamics as short-term, and the fundamentals of our sales strategy remain the same. Our teams are committed to helping improve clinical practice and ensuring the hardware our customers have purchased is used to benefit a broader range of patients requiring respiratory support.

Our Homecare product group delivered revenue of $249.9 million, representing growth of 10 per cent on the first half last year or 4 per cent in constant currency. Pleasingly, our OSA masks and accessories revenue increased 10 per cent in constant currency. The early reception to our new Evora™ Full mask has been very favourable. We received 510(k) approval in the United States in April and have since seen strong sales volumes and positive user feedback. This adds to the momentum for our OSA team who are working hard on a robust product pipeline.

# Unlocking Future Growth: Proposed Karaka Campus

We have repeatedly signalled the importance of long-term infrastructure planning to help us deliver on our sustainable, profitable growth strategy and our aspirations of doubling constant currency revenue every five to six years. To take advantage of the opportunities ahead of us, we need more space, and we took an important step in securing this during the first half. In September, we entered into a conditional agreement, subject to approval by the Overseas Investment Office, to purchase a 105-hectare site for an additional New Zealand campus in Karaka, Auckland.
# FRW Healthcare Inc. Interim Report 2023


Gross margin for the half was 59.8 per cent, down from 63.1 per cent in the prior period and below our long-term target of 65 per cent. Elevated freight rates remain a factor – major global routes are seeing prices soften, though legs in and out of New Zealand remain behind this curve, with prices taking longer to normalise. The half has also seen us manage through manufacturing inefficiencies, as we have been carefully balancing demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput and higher rates of absenteeism in our manufacturing workforce due to sickness.

# Strategic Progress

In May, we introduced our latest anesthesia products – Optiflow Switch™ and Optiflow Trace™ – which provide even more compelling reasons to use F&P’s Optiflow technology during general anesthesia and procedural sedation. Adding to our anesthesia salesforce has been a clear priority in the months since and will remain so going forward. Feedback from anesthesiologists continues to be positive and gives us confidence in both the benefit to patients and the size of the market opportunity.

We are continuing with a controlled market release of our new Airvo™ 3 nasal high flow device in Australasia while seeking regulatory clearances further afield. We believe the new device is an attractive proposition, with a closed loop system for targeted oxygen delivery and an integrated battery to allow for more portability through the hospital.

This statement of intent guides the newly formed governance group, comprised of subject matter experts from around the business working together to identify improvements and step-changes globally.

# Board Update

FRW Healthcare Inc. welcomed Cather Simpson, PhD, as a non-executive director in June, bringing the board up to full strength. The Board of Directors has approved an interim dividend of 17.5 cents per share for the six months to 30 September 2022, marking a 3% increase from the prior financial year.

# Profit Share

To recognize the efforts of its employees, the Board has approved a discretionary profit-sharing payment of $4 million for qualifying employees.

|Profit after tax|221.8 NZ$M|95.9 NZ$M|-57%|-65%|

Constant currency (CC) removes the impact of exchange rate movements. This approach is used to assess the Group’s underlying comparative financial performance without any impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Total profit after tax for the period was $95.9 million, a 57% decline from the same period last year, or 65% in constant currency.

# Gross Margin

Gross margin at 59.8% decreased by 533 basis points in constant currency from the same period last year. Continued elevated freight costs and air freight utilization this period impacted constant currency gross margin by approximately 290 basis points compared to pre-COVID-19 rates. Manufacturing inefficiencies were also experienced this year as we balance demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput.

# Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased 8% (3% in constant currency) to $286.5 million, reflecting ongoing expenditure to support global sales growth and development of our product pipeline. R&D spend of $84.2 million grew 11% reflecting underlying growth and the timing of R&D and clinical projects. Over the long term we plan for R&D spend to grow in line with constant currency revenue growth.

# Financing Expenses

The net financing expense increase reflects the exchange losses on the revaluation of foreign currency interest-bearing liabilities. Excluding the impact of foreign currency revaluations, net financing expense was in line with the prior period.

# Tax

Our effective tax rate for the period was 16.1%, down from 26.3% in the prior period reflecting foreign currency translation gains that are non-taxable. The R&D tax credit this period of $7.6 million (Sep 2021: $7.4 million) represents the estimated eligible R&D expenditure incurred during the period. Excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit, the effective tax rate was 22.7% (Sep 2021: 28.8%).

# Revenue

Operating revenue was $690.6 million, a 23% decline from the prior comparable period (PCP) or 27% in constant currency. Hospital revenue decreased 37% in constant currency as we lapped significant COVID-19 driven demand last year and apparent elevated customer inventory levels during this period. Homecare revenue grew 4% in constant currency.
# FRW Healthcare, Inc. Interim Report 2023

# Fisher & Paykel Healthcare - INTERIM REPORT 2023

# FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS

The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates, with approximately 99% of operating revenue generated in currencies other than NZD as shown below:

|Currency|Percentage|Currency Code|Average Daily Spot Rate 2021|Average Daily Spot Rate 2022|Average Conversion Exchange Rate 2021|Average Conversion Exchange Rate 2022|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|US dollars|45%|USD|0.7077|0.6312|0.6769|0.6700|
|Euros|20%|EUR|0.5938|0.6095|0.5594|0.5445|
|Australian dollars|6%| | | | | |
|Japanese yen|6%| | | | | |
|Chinese yuan|4%| | | | | |
|British pounds|3%| | | | | |
|Canadian dollars|3%| | | | | |
|Korean won|3%| | | | | |
|New Zealand dollars|1%| | | | | |
|Other currencies|9%| | | | | |

Approximately 60% of COGS and over 50% of operating expenses are in currencies other than NZD.

Net profit after tax was increased by $6.1 million compared to the prior period due to the impact of foreign currency.

The effect of balance sheet translations for the period resulted in an increase in operating revenue of $18.6 million (Sep 2021: $2.5 million increase) and an increase in profit after tax of $0.8 million (Sep 2021: $2.4 million increase).

The hedging programme contributed a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million (Sep 2021: $21.1 million gain).

The average daily spot rate and the average conversion exchange rate of the main foreign currency exposures for the reported periods are set out in the table above.

# Analysis of Operating Cash Flows

Cash flows from operations for the period decreased to $1.9 million. Working capital was impacted by increases in inventories due to demand fluctuations and supply chain disruption.

# Capital Expenditure

A total of $124.8 million was spent on capital expenditure during the period, including investments in land, buildings, and equipment.

# Dividends

Dividends paid amounted to $129.9 million, showing a 2% increase from the prior period.

# Summary of Changes

The increase in trade receivables and inventories reflects foreign currency translation and normal operational fluctuations. Property, plant, and equipment increased due to investments, while intangible assets saw a slight increase primarily from patent acquisition costs.

# Other Net Assets/Liabilities

Changes in derivative financial instruments and net tax assets were notable during the period, reflecting currency volatility and effective hedging strategies.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

To the shareholders of Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited

# REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OUR CONCLUSION

We have reviewed the consolidated financial statements of Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group),
which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2022, and the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months period
ended on that date, and other explanatory information.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group do
not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2022, and its financial performance and cash flows for the
six months period then ended on that date, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) and New Zealand
Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (NZ IAS 34).

BASIS FOR CONCLUSION

We conducted our review in accordance with the New Zealand Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements Performed
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of
the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual financial
statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these ethical requirements. In addition to our role as auditor,
our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of executive remuneration benchmarking and providing market survey data, regulatory
tax compliance procedures in Mexico, and other assurance services in relation to constant currency disclosures. The provision of these other services
has not impaired our independence.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS’ FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Directors of the Company are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IAS 34 and NZ IAS 34 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated financial statements based on our review. NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 and NZ IAS 34.

A review of consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we might identify in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these consolidated financial statements.

WHO WE REPORT TO

This report is made solely to the Company’s Shareholders, as a body. Our review work has been undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in our review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Shareholders, as a body, for our review procedures, for this report, or for the conclusion we have formed.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Keren Blakey.

# Half Year Review

The word ‘commitment’ has long held significant meaning for us. One of our five company values, it has resonated strongly in recent months as we reflect on the efforts required through the pandemic period. It resonates further still as we move forward, describing the focus on our long-term aims and the discipline required to achieve them.

Getting our life-preserving product out to patients was paramount during the peak of the pandemic – this came first, and everything else flowed from that. As we said back in May at our full-year result, we did not let these events divert us from our long-term course, and that is worth repeating now. We remain committed to sustainable, profitable growth, and our confidence in the future is unchanged. We are investing significantly in that future and, as we do so, our people are focused on identifying the right near-term actions that strengthen us for the long term.

# Financial Results

As we said in our trading update in August, revenue was down on the prior period but elevated compared with pre-pandemic levels. For the six months ended 30 September 2022, total operating revenue was $690.6 million, 23 per cent below the same period last year, or 27 per cent in constant currency. This represents a 21 per cent increase on the first half of the 2020 financial year ($570.9 million). Net profit after tax was $95.9 million, 57 per cent below the same period last year, or 65 per cent in constant currency.

# FRW Healthcare, Inc. Interim Report 2023

# Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Interim Report 2023

Our Hospital product group comprised 64 per cent of revenue at $438.7 million, representing a 35 per cent decline on the prior year, or 37 per cent in constant currency. This marks a 24 per cent increase compared to the comparable pre-pandemic period, being the first half of the 2020 year ($353.6 million). Hospital consumables sales in constant currency were down 19 per cent on the prior year, but up 25 per cent on the first half of 2020. We believe customer stock levels have been elevated during the first half, reflecting hospital purchases of considerable amounts of product in preparation for an Omicron wave which, for the most part, proved less severe than originally anticipated. Ultimately, we see these stocking dynamics as short-term, and the fundamentals of our sales strategy remain the same. Our teams are committed to helping improve clinical practice and ensuring the hardware our customers have purchased is used to benefit a broader range of patients requiring respiratory support.

Our Homecare product group delivered revenue of $249.9 million, representing growth of 10 per cent on the first half last year or 4 per cent in constant currency. Pleasingly, our OSA masks and accessories revenue increased 10 per cent in constant currency. The early reception to our new Evora™ Full mask has been very favourable. We received 510(k) approval in the United States in April and have since seen strong sales volumes and positive user feedback. This adds to the momentum for our OSA team who are working hard on a robust product pipeline.

# Unlocking Future Growth: Proposed Karaka Campus

We have repeatedly signalled the importance of long-term infrastructure planning to help us deliver on our sustainable, profitable growth strategy and our aspirations of doubling constant currency revenue every five to six years. To take advantage of the opportunities ahead of us, we need more space, and we took an important step in securing this during the first half. In September, we entered into a conditional agreement, subject to approval by the Overseas Investment Office, to purchase a 105-hectare site for an additional New Zealand campus in Karaka, Auckland.
# FRW Healthcare Inc. Interim Report 2023


Gross margin for the half was 59.8 per cent, down from 63.1 per cent in the prior period and below our long-term target of 65 per cent. Elevated freight rates remain a factor – major global routes are seeing prices soften, though legs in and out of New Zealand remain behind this curve, with prices taking longer to normalise. The half has also seen us manage through manufacturing inefficiencies, as we have been carefully balancing demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput and higher rates of absenteeism in our manufacturing workforce due to sickness.

# Strategic Progress

In May, we introduced our latest anesthesia products – Optiflow Switch™ and Optiflow Trace™ – which provide even more compelling reasons to use F&P’s Optiflow technology during general anesthesia and procedural sedation. Adding to our anesthesia salesforce has been a clear priority in the months since and will remain so going forward. Feedback from anesthesiologists continues to be positive and gives us confidence in both the benefit to patients and the size of the market opportunity.

We are continuing with a controlled market release of our new Airvo™ 3 nasal high flow device in Australasia while seeking regulatory clearances further afield. We believe the new device is an attractive proposition, with a closed loop system for targeted oxygen delivery and an integrated battery to allow for more portability through the hospital.

|Profit before tax|301.1 NZ$M|114.3 NZ$M|-62%|-67%|
|Tax expense|(79.3) NZ$M|(18.4) NZ$M|-77%|-74%|
|Profit after tax|221.8 NZ$M|95.9 NZ$M|-57%|-65%|

Constant currency (CC) removes the impact of exchange rate movements. This approach is used to assess the Group’s underlying comparative financial performance without any impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

Total profit after tax for the period was $95.9 million, a 57% decline from the same period last year, or 65% in constant currency.

# Gross Margin

Gross margin at 59.8% decreased by 533 basis points in constant currency from the same period last year. Continued elevated freight costs and air freight utilization this period impacted constant currency gross margin by approximately 290 basis points compared to pre-COVID-19 rates. Manufacturing inefficiencies were also experienced this year as we balance demand fluctuations with manufacturing throughput.

# Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased 8% (3% in constant currency) to $286.5 million, reflecting ongoing expenditure to support global sales growth and development of our product pipeline. R&D spend of $84.2 million grew 11% reflecting underlying growth and the timing of R&D and clinical projects. Over the long term we plan for R&D spend to grow in line with constant currency revenue growth.

# Financing Expenses

The net financing expense increase reflects the exchange losses on the revaluation of foreign currency interest-bearing liabilities. Excluding the impact of foreign currency revaluations, net financing expense was in line with the prior period.

# Tax

Our effective tax rate for the period was 16.1%, down from 26.3% in the prior period reflecting foreign currency translation gains that are non-taxable. The R&D tax credit this period of $7.6 million (Sep 2021: $7.4 million) represents the estimated eligible R&D expenditure incurred during the period. Excluding the benefit of the R&D tax credit, the effective tax rate was 22.7% (Sep 2021: 28.8%).

# Revenue

Operating revenue was $690.6 million, a 23% decline from the prior comparable period (PCP) or 27% in constant currency. Hospital revenue decreased 37% in constant currency as we lapped significant COVID-19 driven demand last year and apparent elevated customer inventory levels during this period. Homecare revenue grew 4% in constant currency.
# FRW Healthcare, Inc. Interim Report 2023

# Fisher & Paykel Healthcare - INTERIM REPORT 2023

# FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS

The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates, with approximately 99% of operating revenue generated in currencies other than NZD as shown below:

|Currency|Percentage|Currency Code|Average Daily Spot Rate 2021|Average Daily Spot Rate 2022|Average Conversion Exchange Rate 2021|Average Conversion Exchange Rate 2022|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|US dollars|45%|USD|0.7077|0.6312|0.6769|0.6700|
|Euros|20%|EUR|0.5938|0.6095|0.5594|0.5445|
|Australian dollars|6%| | | | | |
|Japanese yen|6%| | | | | |
|Chinese yuan|4%| | | | | |
|British pounds|3%| | | | | |
|Canadian dollars|3%| | | | | |
|Korean won|3%| | | | | |
|New Zealand dollars|1%| | | | | |
|Other currencies|9%| | | | | |

Approximately 60% of COGS and over 50% of operating expenses are in currencies other than NZD.

Net profit after tax was increased by $6.1 million compared to the prior period due to the impact of foreign currency.

The effect of balance sheet translations for the period resulted in an increase in operating revenue of $18.6 million (Sep 2021: $2.5 million increase) and an increase in profit after tax of $0.8 million (Sep 2021: $2.4 million increase).

The hedging programme contributed a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million (Sep 2021: $21.1 million gain).

The average daily spot rate and the average conversion exchange rate of the main foreign currency exposures for the reported periods are set out in the table above.

comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months period
ended on that date, and other explanatory information.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group do
not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2022, and its financial performance and cash flows for the
six months period then ended on that date, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) and New Zealand
Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting (NZ IAS 34).

BASIS FOR CONCLUSION

We conducted our review in accordance with the New Zealand Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (Revised) Review of Financial Statements Performed
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (NZ SRE 2410 (Revised)). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of
the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements in New Zealand relating to the audit of the annual financial
statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these ethical requirements. In addition to our role as auditor,
our firm carries out other services for the Group in the areas of executive remuneration benchmarking and providing market survey data, regulatory
tax compliance procedures in Mexico, and other assurance services in relation to constant currency disclosures. The provision of these other services
has not impaired our independence.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS’ FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Directors of the Company are responsible on behalf of the Company for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IAS 34 and NZ IAS 34 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE REVIEW OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the consolidated financial statements based on our review. NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 and NZ IAS 34.

A review of consolidated financial statements in accordance with NZ SRE 2410 (Revised) is a limited assurance engagement. We perform procedures, primarily consisting of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. The procedures performed in a review are substantially less than those performed in an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we might identify in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on these consolidated financial statements.

WHO WE REPORT TO

This report is made solely to the Company’s Shareholders, as a body. Our review work has been undertaken so that we might state those matters which we are required to state to them in our review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Shareholders, as a body, for our review procedures, for this report, or for the conclusion we have formed.

The engagement partner on the review resulting in this independent auditor’s review report is Keren Blakey.
